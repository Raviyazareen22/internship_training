#### circuit verse tutorial
CircuitVerse (CV) simulator is a cloud-based open source tool for building live circuit simulations. Use the CircuitVerse documentation to learn about the interface and different features and functionalities. You can read it from start to finish, or use it as a reference.

Description:
1	Menu bar:	Displays different options available in the menu bar for managing and creating projects
2	Circuit Elements Panel:	Displays different circuit elements for building the circuit.
3	Properties Panel:	Displays different properties available for the selected circuit element.
4	Circuit Tabs:	Displays different circuits and sub-circuits available within the selected project.
5	Quick Access Panel:	Displays task icons for the common CircuitVerse workflows.
6	Timing Diagram:	Displays the level of each input and output after each clock pulse for determining the circuit behavior
7	Report System:	Displays a dialog box for reporting an issue or bug to the CircuitVerse support team.
8	Canvas:	Display area where the circuit elements can be assembled for building the desired circuit.

Every circuit simulation project created within CircuitVerse can be exported as a Verilog code. As Figure 3.11 illustrates, the code file can then either be downloaded on the machine as a verilog file or tested on edaplayground
